# 🎸 Band Name Generator

This is a beginner-friendly Python project that generates a fun and unique band name based on user input. It's part of my "Daily Python Projects" series to improve my coding consistency and skills.

## 💡 Project Overview

The Band Name Generator takes two inputs:
- The name of a city you grew up in
- The name of your pet (or a favorite animal)

It then combines these to generate a cool and quirky band name!

## 🚀 Features

- Simple command-line interaction using `input()`
- Combines user input creatively
- Great first project to practice Python basics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb` format)

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open the `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or VS Code.
2. Run each cell.
3. Enter your responses when prompted.

OR run in a Python file:

```bash
